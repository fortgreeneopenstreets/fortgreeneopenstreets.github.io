# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  We're a group of neighbors who advocate for the Willoughby Avenue Open Street in Brooklyn's neighborhood of Fort Greene, and the Hall Street Open Street in Clinton Hill. Willoughby Avenue and Hall Street Open Streets are open public spaces for residents to stroll, kids to play, dogs to be walked and friends and neighbors to gather, while still allowing for limited local access for vehicles.
