## About us

We're a group of neighbors who act as community liasons for the [Open Streets](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openstreets.shtml) program on **Willoughby Ave**, **South Portland Ave** and **Hall St**, in and around Fort Greene, Brooklyn. These streets are closed to cars, and open to people, 24 hours, 7 days a week. See [here](#map) for a full map. Operation of the street is managed by the [City Cleanup Corps](https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-03376), in partnership with [The Hort](https://www.thehort.org/).

We want to create an open public space for residents to stroll, kids to play, and friends to gather. If you want to get involved (perhaps plan an event on the street?), please get in touch at <info@fortgreeneopenstreets.org>.
