## About us

We’re a group of neighbors who advocate for the **Willoughby Avenue Open Street** in Brooklyn’s neighborhood of Fort Greene, and the **Hall Street Open Street** in Clinton Hill. Willoughby Avenue and Hall Street Open Streets are open public spaces for residents to stroll, kids to play, dogs to be walked and friends and neighbors to gather, while still allowing for limited local access for vehicles. The hours for both Open Streets are 8:00am - 8:00pm.

Operation and Maintenance of the Willoughby Avenue Open Street is managed by [The Hort](https://www.thehort.org/), through a contract with the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT). Please direct any inquiries regarding the operation or maintenance of the Willoughby Avenue Open Street to: <openstreets@dot.nyc.gov>

For questions about the Fort Greene Open Streets Coalition, get in touch at: <info@fortgreeneopenstreets.org>.
